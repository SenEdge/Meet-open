🔍 Technical Challenges of Small Models in Edge AI

Lower Accuracy vs Large LLMs / ASR Models
Problem: Small ASR (like Whisper Tiny) or LLMs (like TinyLLaMA) may underperform in:
    •    Domain-specific vocabulary (e.g., technical or corporate meetings)
    •    Speaker diarization (who said what)
    •    Grammar and contextual understanding in summarization

Mitigation:
    •    ✏️ Fine-tune on domain-specific data using LoRA or QLoRA.
    •    🧩 Prompt engineering for LLM summarization—add structure like:
“You are a professional meeting assistant. Return bullet points and action items.”
    •    🧠 Two-stage pipeline:
    •    Use lightweight LLM for extraction (key points)
    •    Offload complex synthesis (summary wording) to backend or optional cloud call

Inference Latency on Limited Hardware
Problem: Even small models (e.g., Whisper Tiny, LLaMA 3B) can be slow on-device:
    •    Long meetings → high latency and CPU usage
    •    User expects real-time or fast summarization

Mitigation:
    •    🧮 Use quantized models (int8, 4-bit with GGML, GPTQ, or ExLlama).
    •    📦 Process in chunks (e.g., 30s–1min segments) with parallel threads.
    •    ⏱️ Use ONNX or TensorRT acceleration (for Jetson or iOS CoreML).

⸻

Memory Constraints (RAM & VRAM)
Problem: Edge devices (Jetson Nano, mobile CPUs) have:
    •    Limited RAM (≤ 4 GB)
    •    No GPU/accelerator

Mitigation:
    •    🧠 Use distilled or compressed models:
    •    DistilWhisper, DistilBERT, or MobileBERT
    •    🪶 Use low-memory execution frameworks:
    •    GGML, MPS on iOS, or CoreML + MLX

⸻

Real-time Processing (Streaming ASR & Summary)
Problem: Full-model inference is expensive in real-time, especially without GPU acceleration.

Mitigation:
    •    🧊 Use streaming-capable ASR (WhisperStream, Vosk).
    •    💡 Build a buffered queue pipeline:
    •    Start summarizing previous chunks while new audio is transcribed.

⸻

Energy Efficiency & Thermal Constraints
Problem: On phones or edge devices, continuous inference causes:
    •    Device heating
    •    Battery drain

Mitigation:
    •    💤 Use dynamic model scheduling:
    •    Pause heavy summarization if no speech detected (use silence detection).
    •    🧩 Offload heavy computation only when network is available (hybrid mode).
    •    ⚙️ Use Edge TPU / NPU where possible (e.g., iOS Neural Engine, Jetson Nano GPU).

🔭 Example Efficient Architecture for senedge-meet

On-device (iOS):
    •    📥 Audio stream → Whisper Tiny (quantized via CoreML) → transcript chunks
    •    🧠 Local LLM (e.g., TinyLLaMA or DistilBERT via MLX/CoreML) → extract key points
    •    📤 On-demand summary refinement via cloud (optional)

Backend (optional):
    •    Whisper Large + GPT-4 for fallback summaries when privacy or latency is not critical

🧪 Final Thoughts

The real challenge isn’t just using small models—it’s smart orchestration:
    •    Know when to run lightweight models
    •    When to pause processing
    •    And when (if ever) to call the cloud

Let me know if you want:
    •    Specific small model recommendations (Whisper variants, LLMs)
    •    Help converting models to CoreML or quantized formats
    •    A working prototype pipeline design
